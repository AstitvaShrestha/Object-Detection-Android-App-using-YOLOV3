# Object Detection Android App using YOLOV3

The aim of this project was to build an Android AI App to detect objects using deep learning model. The app uses OpenCV with Android Studio to process frames and predict the object using **yolov3** weights and Darknet Model.

## Installation
You need to install [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/releases/) for android. Also put yolov3(https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) weights and cfg file in internal storage in dnns folder as the app reads the configuration and weights for the model from here.
